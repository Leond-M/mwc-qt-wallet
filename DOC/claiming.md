The purpose of this page is to explain how to claim MWC from the Airdrop once the claims period has opened. First off,
you need the latest MWC qt wallet. The latest version can be obtained here:
https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-qt-wallet/releases

Once you have obtained the wallet you will notice the airdrop tab on the top left side.
